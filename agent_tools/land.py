"""Land an approved run: pick the branch it lives on, cherry-pick it onto a
fresh PR branch, open the PR, wait for it to go green, merge, and clean up.

`land_plan` and `pr_body` are pure: given the task record (the json at
`runs/<run>/tasks/<phase>/<task>.json`) and, for each candidate branch, the
commit subjects the edge found ahead of the default branch, they return the
ordered steps or a single `refuse` step naming why. `branches` already
excludes merge commits — the edge gathers it with `git log --no-merges`,
because a merge commit is a fact git holds (parent count), not something a
commit subject reliably spells out. The record is expected to carry `run`,
`task`, `phase`, and `initiative` (the edge fills the first three in from the
file's own path when the record itself is silent on them) plus `proposals`,
`review`, `arbitration`, `change_facts`, and `build`; a record silent on
`initiative` still lands cleanly off the scratch branch, and only fails to
resolve a phase branch, which becomes the ordinary "no branch is exactly one
commit ahead" refuse rather than a crash. `cli.py` is the edge: it gathers
the record and the branches with `git log`, then walks the plan through
`subprocess` and `gh`.
