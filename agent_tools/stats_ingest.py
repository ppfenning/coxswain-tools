"""Loads the run corpus into the stats store (workspace/stats/stats.db).

Spec: docs/design/run-stats-store.md §3-§4. Spike verdict:
agent_tools/stats-join-spike.md — the calls-to-tasks join is heuristic: a
run's build calls get `task_id`/`join_confidence='heuristic'` in ticket order
only where `sum(fix_loop.attempts)` over its task records equals its build
call count (171/184 runs in the spike); every other call, in every other run,
gets `join_confidence='none'` and no `task_id` rather than a guess. Row-shaping
(`run_row`, `call_rows`, `recovered_call_rows`, `task_row`, `run_join_holds`,
`assign_task_ids`, `fill_failure_classes`) is pure over already-parsed JSON;
`load_run`, `discover_runs` and `ingest` are the edge that reads files
(including each call's own trace and the autonomy ledger) and writes the database.
